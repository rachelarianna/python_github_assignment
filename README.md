# Savings Tracker
This program allows the user to track their savings progress each month to allow for better financial decision making. This ensures they stay on track to meeting their financial savings goal each month with ease. 
## How to Run
All the user has to do is input about how much they have currently made in the month, and how much they expect to save each month. The program then does the calculations for the user to determine their progress. 

EXAMPLE:

How much did you save this past month? 300. 

How much do you want to save this month? 500. 

You have saved 60.0% of your monthly goal.
